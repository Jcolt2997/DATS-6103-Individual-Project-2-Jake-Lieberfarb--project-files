# DATS-6103-Individual-Project-2-Jake-Lieberfarb--project-files

Hello! Welcome to my analysis on US weather events from 2018 to 2019 to see which US state and county would be the safest to live in.
Data was pulled from a [NOAA dataset](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/stormevents/ftp.jsp). "Safe" is defined as the state which sees low total property damage brought
on by storm events proportional to its size. Below are the questions and their corresponding visuals asked to get to the final conclusion 
on which state and county are the safest for someone to live in. 

If you wish to run the Jupyter notebook file, you can download, "DATS-6103-Individual-Project-2-Jake-Lieberfarb-project-files.zip", unzip it, and run the files 
on your own environment. In the zip file you find the jupyter notebook code, html link, and datasources. If you have any question, please email me at Jakelieberfarb@gmail.com.
